# Examples of Installation

The robot arm can be installed on the floor, wall, or any desired location, and it can also be mounted on a fixed post. The fixed post is not included with the product.

Additionally, it can be installed on walls, ceilings, or at any arbitrary angle. For installations other than flat surfaces, the installation angle must be entered through the system settings.

::: warning

1. When attaching the robot, fix it firmly so that the bolts do not come loose.
2. Install the robot on a sturdy surface that can withstand the combined weight of the robot and the load generated by the robot.
3. Please ensure that the mounting surface on the robot arm is completely in contact with the surface that it is mounted upon.
4. Never disassemble the bolts that are assembled in the robot. Ensure that all bolts are securely fastened before operating the robot arm.
5. If the bolts are not fastened properly, or if a bracket etc. is installed incorrectly, the product may become damaged, or the safety of the user may be seriously affected.

# User Safety

For the userâ€™s safety, please note the following:

- Powerless robot operation<br>
  In case of an emergency, or in any situation without power, the user can move the robot arm by forcing the joints into a different configuration (forced back driving).<br>
  To perform forced back driving, the user must push or pull the robot arm firmly. Please ensure that the robot is not powered-on while performing forced back driving.

<div class="warning custom-block">
  <p class="custom-block-title">CAUTION</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If excessive force is applied to the joints in the non-powered state, please be aware that the driving part may be overloaded. The manufacturer is not responsible for any damage caused by excessive force.
    </li>
  </ul>

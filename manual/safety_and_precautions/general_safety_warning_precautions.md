    <ol>
        <li>
            Robot users and robot application system manufacturers should be familiar with the contents of this manual. In addition, they should complete operational training.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure enough space is provided for the robot arm to move freely.
        </li>
        <li>
            When using the robot, do not wear loose clothes or jewelry. Long hair should be tied so that it does not get caught in the joints of the robot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Never operate a broken or faulty robot.
        </li>
        <li>
            If a fatal error occurs in the software, immediately hit the emergency switch to stop the robot, and then contact your supplier or Rainbow Robotics.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check that the robot installation angle, tool setting, safety setting, etc. are entered correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not connect safety equipment to the general use I/O ports in the back of the control box. Safety equipment should only be used with safety-related I/O ports.
        </li>
        <li>
            Watch out for the movement of the robot when using the teaching pendant.
        </li>
        <li>
            During the operation of the robot, do not enter the operating range of the robot, and do not touch the robot while it is operating.
        </li>
        <li>
            Never modify the robot without the support of Rainbow Robotics. Rainbow Robotics (hereinafter "the manufacturer") bears no responsibility/liability for any problems caused by user's modification or modification of the product.
        </li>
        <li>
            Both the robot arm and the control box generate heat when used for a long time. Do not touch the robot after long use. If the user needs to touch the robot, make sure to turn off the controller and allow the robot to cool down before touching.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the robot collides with an external object, a considerable amount of kinetic energy is generated. This kinetic energy is proportional to the speed of the robot and the payload.
        </li>
        <li>
            Confirm that you are using the recommended installation settings for the robot. The teaching or collision detection functions may not work properly if the robot arm's mounting configuration, tool weight, tool center of gravity, length, safety configuration, etc. are not entered correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
            The teaching function should only be used in a safe environment. Do not use this function when there are hazards nearby.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before using the teaching function, input the relevant information (tool length, weight, center of gravity, etc.) accurately. Not entering the accurate relevant specifications will cause malfunctions when using the direct teaching function.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the robot joints move at an unsafe speed when using the direct teaching function, the user can force the robot to stop with the emergency switch for their safety.
        </li>
        <li>
            Robotic arm and control box generate heat during operation. Do not touch the robot arm during operation or immediately after operation as continuous contact with the robot arm may cause it to malfunction. Before manipulating or touching the robot arm, make sure to check the temperature reading on the UI screen or turn off the robot arm. Please wait at least 1 hour to cool it down before touching.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="custom-block-title">CAUTION</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            When using with a machine or another robot that can damage the robot arm, it is recommended to test all functions separately before use. The manufacturer is not liable for any programming errors, damage to the RB, or damage to other machines due to robot malfunctions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not expose the robot to strong magnetic fields as the robot may be damaged.
        </li>
    </ol>

<div class="warning custom-block">
    <p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Attach a warning label to the spot where there is a danger of electric shock from the electric device.
        </li>
        <li>
            Do not tear, damage, or remove the cover. Be careful when handling parts or devices with a label attached, as well as surrounding components.
        </li>
        <li>
            To avoid electric shock, do not touch the internal electric parts.
        </li>

# Brake System

The configuration of the Brake System on each axis of the robot arm consists of a support frame, solenoid, brake ring, brake shaft, brake spring and brake wing, which are installed on the robot joint as shown below.

If the solenoid is on, the physical interference between the turning radius of the brake ring and the brake wing is released, and if the solenoid is off, the physical interference between the end of the brake ring and the brake wing occurs, which stops the rotation of the driveshaft.

When the brake ring rotates and pushes through the brake wing, the wing returns to the spring force, and then a bi-directional brake occurs through physical interference, keeping both bi-directional rotations of the driveshaft stationary.

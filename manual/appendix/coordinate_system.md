# Coordinate System

![missing](/manual/common/appendix/f/1.png)

### Global Coordinate

Once the robot is fixed with the coordinate system fixed to the base of the robot, the global coordinate system is also fixed.<br>
The center of the base surface is the origin. Set the robot direction to the +Z direction from the origin and the connector direction to the +Y direction from the origin.

### Local Coordinate

Coordinate system fixed to TCP (Tool Center Point) of the robot, the direction of the axis changes in real time by setting or moving the TCP offset.<br>
Set TCP as the origin and set the robot direction from the origin to the +Y direction and the teach button direction from the origin to the +Z direction.

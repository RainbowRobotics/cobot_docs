1. Import the existing settings.
2. Select the digital input port to be used.
3. Choose the function to use. The functions are categorized as Load, Load + Play (Once), and Load + Play (Repeat).
4. Select the project to be used via the digital input.
5. Save the configured settings.

The existing Start Program function under ‘Setup > I/O1’ in Control Box Digital Input Function Definition can only utilize one digital input and can only execute the main program currently uploaded to the control box.<br>
In contrast, Setup > Program Table allows you to load different programs for different digital inputs, enabling program execution and other functionalities.<br>

You can see the differences between the two functions in the diagram below.

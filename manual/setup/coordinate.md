# Set-up (Coordinate)

This section is for configuring a user-defined coordinate system (User-Coordinate).

![missing](/manual/en/setup/11.png)

1. Displays the Current User-Defined Coordinate System Information. The information is displayed relative to the manufacturerâ€™s robot base coordinate system.
2. Modify the Settings for User-Defined Coordinate Systems. You can set up to three user-defined coordinate systems.<br>
   Each coordinate is defined with the robot arm base as the origin.<br>
   Set the coordinate system through the 3-point setting.<br>

   Point 1 (P1): This is the origin of the user-defined coordinate system.<br>
   Point 2 (P2): This is any point on the X-axis of the user-defined coordinate system. It is recommended to set P2 as far from P1 as possible.<br>
   Point 3 (P3): This is any point on the XY plane of the user-defined coordinate system. The direction of the Z-axis is determined based on the position of Point 3.

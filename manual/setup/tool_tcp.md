# Set-up (Tool/TCP)

You can configure the settings related to the installed tool.

![missing](/manual/en/setup/3.png)

1. The Tool Center Point (TCP) coordinate system for each robot model is displayed.<br>
   Enter the values on the right based on this coordinate system.
2. Set the load applied to the robot.<br>
   The mass should be entered in the 'Mass' field (unit: kg), and the input range varies depending on the robot model's rated load.<br>
   The distance to the center of gravity is entered in the 'Center of gravity' field (unit: mm).
3. Configure the TCP coordinate system. You can set the linear position (X, Y, Z) and rotation angles (RX, RY, RZ).
4. Set the range of the tool area based on the TCP coordinate system. The area within this range is treated as a self-collision zone.
5. Save the changed settings.

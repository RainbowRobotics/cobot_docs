# Set-up (Security)

This section allows you to set passwords for different menu screens or configure display settings.

![missing](/manual/en/setup/12.png)

1. You can assign a password to each screen handled by the UI.
2. - **Always Keep Screen On** : Enables the screen to remain on when using Make and Play modes.<br>
     (This prevents disconnection when the screen is off, but may drain the battery quickly, so use with caution.)
   - **Gesture Mode** : When enabled, you can navigate the screen using up/down gestures.
